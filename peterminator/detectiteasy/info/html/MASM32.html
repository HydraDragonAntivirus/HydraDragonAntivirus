The MASM32 SDK is targeted at experienced programmers who are familiar with writing software in 32 bit versions of Windows using the API interface and who are familiar with at least some direct mnemonic programming in assembler. It is not well suited for beginner programmers due to the advanced technical nature of programming in assembler and beginners are advised to start with a compiler first to learn basic concepts like addressing, programming logic, control flow and similar.
