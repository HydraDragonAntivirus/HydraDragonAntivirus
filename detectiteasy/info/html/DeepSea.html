Obfuscation is critical for the protection of your Intellectual Property in .NET applications. Because of the nature of the .NET framework, your applications will show a lot of your Intellectual Property. Obfuscation will change the name of your classes and members to unreadable characters. This make understanding your code much more complicated.

DeepSea Obfuscator will automatically detect code that cannot be obfuscated using its Smart Protection rules. You can also exclude classes and/or members from obfuscation using standard Obfuscation attributes or an External Configuration file.
