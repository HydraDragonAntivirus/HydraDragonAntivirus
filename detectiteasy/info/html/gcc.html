The GNU Compiler Collection includes front ends for C, C++, Objective-C, Fortran, Java, Ada, and Go, as well as libraries for these languages (libstdc++, libgcj, ...).

GCC was originally written as the compiler for the GNU operating system.

The GNU system was developed to be 100% free software, free in the sense that it respects the user's freedom.
