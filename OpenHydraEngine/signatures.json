    "description": "This signature combines all major features of the OpenHydra engine. It targets files that show a dynamic memory dump deviation (MEMDUMP) from the clean baseline, have TLS callback addresses in a suspicious range, and contain a modified DOS stub. It also flags files with high-entropy overlay sections, invalid or missing certificate data, missing delay imports, anomalies in the load configuration, unverified bound imports, and unusual section characteristics. Finally, it checks for corrupt extended headers and inconsistent Rich header information. This multi-faceted signature is designed to detect sophisticated malware that uses obfuscation, packing, or injection techniques by correlating dynamic sandbox outputs with detailed static PE analysis.\nAdditional Notes: Enter additional notes, examples, or instructions for the signature here..."
